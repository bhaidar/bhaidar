# 👋 Hello, I'm Bilal Haidar

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I’m a **Full-Stack Laravel Consultant** and **Software Engineer** with 20+ years of experience building scalable, modern web applications.

## 🚀 About Me

I specialize in **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, designing end-to-end solutions that combine clean architecture, robust backend APIs, and seamless front-end experiences.  

My focus is on:
- Building **multi-tenant SaaS platforms** and **enterprise-grade web systems**
- Designing **modular, testable Laravel architectures** using service containers, managers, and queues
- Integrating **payment gateways**, **RESTful APIs**, and **cloud infrastructure**

Beyond development, I’m a **content creator** and **mentor**, helping engineers learn to think architecturally, write elegant code, and grow into full-stack professionals.

Continuous learning keeps my solutions efficient, maintainable, and future-proof.
